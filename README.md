# MonopolyBanker

This Flutter project serves as a practice application for NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, specifically intended for reading "bank" cards from the board game Monopoly. It is important to note that this project is purely educational and non-commercial. All rights of Monopoly and its associated company are reserved.

## What is NFC?

NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a short-range wireless technology that allows communication between devices at a distance of approximately 4 cm or less. It enables contactless data transfer, making it ideal for various applications such as mobile payments, access control, and data sharing between devices.
